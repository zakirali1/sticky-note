# Django App - Sticky Notes

## Description

This app demonstrates the ease of using Django to built web applications. I have used the ORM to keep a database of the fields that need to persist. I used Django for the front and back end, alongside CSS, Javascript and AJAX.

Libraries also include bootstrap.
